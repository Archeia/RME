# RME Incubator
> Exerimenting before integration

- This build contains **temporary fixes and additions** that have not been **well tested and validated** yet.
- This build will not be built into **RME.rb**... *wip only*.
- This build will be loaded in devlopers / contributors projects only (confers **src/README.md** *"How to initialize a project"*)
- The scripts in this build __will be merged into the main build (RME scripts built into RME.rb) after testing and validation__.
- The scripts in this build __does not need to respect any "RMEx/RME" design__ (comments everywhere) because they are **in progress**, everybody can contribute using **their own working methods**. The "usal RME design" will be applied while merging into *the main build* (RME).
- **RME.unsafe?** stands for additions/fixes that can damage the behavior of RME / RGSS3
